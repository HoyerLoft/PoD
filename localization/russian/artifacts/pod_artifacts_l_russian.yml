 artifact_universal_solvent_description:0 "Universal Solvent is a result of Nocker investigation into chimerical alchemy and is the greatest (and among the rarest) products of this science. The solvent is a binary compound; the alchemist must keep its parts in two separate bottles (one Black, one White, usually). When the nocker mixes the two components, a dense cloud of pure Banality pours forth, dissolving every chimerical object in its path, including changelings in their fae mien." #NT!

Gathered up off the ground along a special path, they have the ability to lead a pooka back home if they should stray. Most pooka own two of them: one to leave at the point of departure and one carried with the pooka to serve as the scent. So long as the pooka remembers to leave one at home and doesn’t lose the one they're carrying, they can eventually sniff their way back. Obviously, they could also be shared between friends so the pooka could find the other person in case they were separated. " #NT!

The shoemaker nursed the cat back to health and in exchange, the cat, who was a pooka, helped the shoemaker. For a year and a day, every set of boots that the shoemaker created had the special quality that they made other people ignore the wearer’s presence. Changelings came from around the world to purchase the boots and the shoemaker prospered, retired rich and happy, and eventually the pooka went on his way." #NT!

 artifact_balthazars_bracelets_description:0 "If nothing else, these matching bracelets have a delicate beauty that makes them a special addition to the stash of any pooka who likes pretty, shiny things. However, they also have a very unique benefit when worn. When placed on the wrists, they tighten of their own accord to fit smoothly over the changeling’s forearms, swirling up from wrist to elbow. If the faerie knocks once on the bracelets, they meld to the skin and become ebony tattoos that will shape-shift with the pooka when he changes to his animal mien. In that form, the tattoos simply resemble markings on the animal’s skin." #NT!

Made of amber, the butterfly’s wings blush scarlet near the golden body and lighten to a warm orange near the tips. The changeling that wears the necklace gains the ability to fly in a manner similar to that of the Wind Runner cantrip. A pair of shimmery, intangible wings appear at the faerie’s back. The wings themselves have no substance and cannot be damaged. They disappear as soon as the changeling removes the choker." #NT!

One of these, his flail, is depicted on the sarcophagi of many of the pharaohs that followed in his footsteps. It is usually shown crossed with a crook over the chest of the dead king. The flail is a short-handled rod from which hangs a group of three leather strips decorated with wooden beads and bone. Reportedly, it recorded all of history in the chimerical carvings upon its bone and wood beads. To tap its extensive wisdom, a person simply asked a question, then touched the flail to her brow. The answer came immediately." #NT!

During that time, the victim will attempt to eat anything — and in some cases anyone — he can get his hands on. Dry dust has a variety of uses, ranging from assisting in poisonings to crude practical jokes. Only redcaps seem to know the secret of its manufacture, and the few who have been questioned about it hint darkly at having ground up human bone to make the stuff.

When they tear into an opponent, they want to stay there, and they'll do as much damage as they can. Witnesses (and the very occasional survivor) swear that the blades and whatnot actually move to rend the flesh of a target once a punch connects. The hooks snag the Blooded Gauntlet in place while the rest of the equipment goes to work, ripping its way down to bone and beyond.

Of course, the size of the object being tossed in and the raw materials it's made from impact how long it takes for the Grinder to chew it up once and for all, but in the end, if the redcap with the crank is willing to work at it, the device can dispose of pretty much anything imaginable." #NT!

According to legend, this treasure shows the image of a faceless person until a changeling gazes into it for an extended period of time. Spending one point of Glamour, the faerie begins to see the face of their one true love appearing amidst the tiles.

Because it was born of true love, though, it doesn't trigger generic passions as the Gift of Pan does. Instead it makes those who mourn lost love feel the bittersweet pain more acutely and it urges those who do love to act on their emotions with the target of their affection. The music intensifies all of these feelings and solidifies them forevermore. The one who loves, when they hear the music of Syrinx, will love that person forever and maybe beyond." #NT!

Alternatively, while the weapon is in flight, the wielder can utter a command word to split the weapon into three edged shards.

The willing soul of a demon — his name long since forgotten — was bound into the black metal, where he could use this power upon anyone touched by the blade. The sword’s touch drained the energy and life from anyone it wounded — and if it killed a victim, his soul would be pulled from his corpse and imprisoned within the blade, there to be tortured and devoured by the original demon. Mortals and angels alike fell before Soultaker, their Faith torn apart for his sustenance.\nThen the sword’s bearer used it to slay another demon, and the sword changed. The two demonic souls fought for dominance within the blade, neither able to gain an advantage. Over time, their souls began to bleed into each other, creating a single fractured personality. As demonic infighting grew more serious in the war, more demons fell to Soultaker, and their souls became absorbed into a single insane entity — a being that called itself Legion. Soultaker was lost during the final days of the war, hidden deep in a forgotten weapons cache, and without new victims to devour for Faith, Legion grew weak and thin.
