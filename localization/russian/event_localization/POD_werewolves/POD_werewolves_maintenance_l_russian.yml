As is the duty of any self serving Tribe, you have been scouting for those lost pups and brought the most deserving home with you.\nAfter a time of adaptation needed to teach those lupus the ways of the world beyond their forests, they are now ready to become fully fledged members of your pack." #NT!

 POD_werewolves_maintenance.4.desc:0 "It seems that Gaia hasn't seen fit to bless you today : your baby is a boy. Black Fury's society is very strict on what should be done and you know it to be the way of your tribe for generations now.\nThere are a few male among your people, so you choosing to keep this child wouldn't be unprecedented if you wished to, but it would still be a very big affront to tradition and considered as a sign of weakness by your sisters. At the end of the day however, the choice is yours alone." #NT!

 POD_werewolves_maintenance.5.desc:0 "As a lupus-born, you often have encounters with your non werewolf kind in the forests. Sometimes, these encounters result in new cubs being born.\nThese cubs end up as mundane wolves the vast majority of the time and escape your notice quickly. Sometimes though, one of them experience the First Change and becomes a full fledged werewolf like you did.\nAs a lupus-born, they will need to be taught about the world outside the forests before being useful. But if you are willing to make that effort, they could join you, continuing your legacy for the next generation." #NT!
