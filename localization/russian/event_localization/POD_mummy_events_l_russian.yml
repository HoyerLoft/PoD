 podmummy.5000.desc:0 "Mummies are true immortals but their souls might linger for a while in the afterlife after each "death". As such, the physical body must be properly prepared and attended to by servants during this time. In ages long gone, the great Egyptian mummies had fabulous tombs (or even pyramids) built for them to properly guard their physical form. This era is long gone however, with most of these tombs fallen into disrepair or having been looted by bandits long ago.\nStill, the need remains and you are now considering how to best prepare for your next travel into the afterlife. An option would be to use an existing tomb (perhaps even your own from ages past) and rearrange it, another one would be to build a new place of burial fit for you and away from prying eyes and greedy hands." #NT!

 podmummy.5001.desc:0 "An important problem to assess when thinking about your tomb is its surroundings. Earthquakes, be they natural or triggered by your foes, are as potentially deadly as any pillagers. Many careless mummies found themselves buried under sand and rocks after their resurrection, having to painfully claw their way out during years, or even decades. You would very much like to avoid that fate.\nIf you know the terrain in your area well enough, you could conduct this survey yourself. Otherwise, hiring some learned people under a false pretense should be easy, if costlier." #NT!

 podmummy.5002.desc:0 "Humanity is always growing it seems. Remote places that were once perfect hiding places are now thriving new communities, which can spell trouble for a waking mummy. It's hard to find a place that will realistically not be touched by mortals while still being useful for you, so instead you focused your efforts on making sure the local authorities ban some area that you plan to use. It's not fail proof, but it should keep those pesky inquisitive mortals away for a while.\nStill, there is the concern that mortal authorities come and go and all this effort could be for naught in the end. Perhaps using your newfound influence for other prospects might be a wiser course of action." #NT!

 podmummy.5003.desc:0 "Building a proper tomb takes a lot of planning. Even without going as far as the pyramids of old, a large amount of manpower, materials and skilled architects is needed. These don't come cheap or easily, and the time where mummies could simply order mortals around to do it is past. As such, it takes some planning skill and solid contacts with merchants guilds and such to achieve the needed result.\nThis large commitment could also be used to instead improve the local area if you want to put the priority of your tomb building down a little." #NT!

 podmummy.5004.desc:0 "A tomb needs guards at all time. While the physical body of the mummy lies defenseless in it, all your foes (or even just random raiders) could barge in and desecrate your sanctum. You are thus preparing your tomb guard for the special purpose of fighting in and near your place of burial. These exercises are very specialized though, and not very usable in the field of battle.\nYou could broaden the training a little, but it would likely mean less expertise in tomb guarding for your chosen defenders." #NT!
 podmummy.5004.a:0 "Tomb guards need to learn tomb guarding, nothing more." #NT!

 podmummy.5005.desc:0 "Any tomb worth its name needs traps. While your guards can cover for most dangers, it is still likely that especially determined (or sneaky) foes will get past them. It's where well designed traps come in.\nThere are certainly merits in the good old fashioned boulders, dart throwers or pit of death but a mummy has other, more mystical, options. Using your vast array of alchemical concoctions and living statues, you could craft something really special for anyone foolish enough to enter your place of burial. It could also serve as a good training ground for new Hekau practices if you wish it." #NT!
