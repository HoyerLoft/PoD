 POD_martyrs.1.t:0 "A Procession of Martyrs" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.desc:0 "One after another, the people you hold dear perish in the struggle against the Adversary. However bright they may shine with virtue, it seems to be only a matter of time before their flame is engulfed, suffocated and extinguished by the unrelenting darkness. Sometimes when you close your eyes you see the faces of those who died, violently and prematurely, looking at you with indecipherable expressions." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.a:0 "And I am honoured to walk in their footsteps." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.a.tt:0 "This option is available because I have the [GetTrait('beatific').GetName( GetPlayer )] trait." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.b:0 "What is God telling me?" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.b.tt:0 "You will pray for guidance." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.c:0 "I won't let this happen to me!" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.c.tt:0 "You will take a crash course on self-defense." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.1.d:0 "Everyone has to die eventually." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.2.t:0 "True faith doesn't question." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.2.desc:0 "You've known this for a long time: there is only one direction to go and that is towards God's light. It is utterly irrelevant what kind of suffering lies on the way for you or anyone else, there is simply no other choice to make. It does not bother you whether you're about to step on burning embers or venomous snakes for you are following the Lord." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.2.a:0 "There was never any doubt." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.3.t:0 "Take up your cross!" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.3.desc:0 "Not long into your prayer you experience a kind of a gentle nudge that sends your mind plummeting into a single, crystal-clear conclusion: All your life you vowed to follow the path of Christ, why should you stray from it on its final section? The conviction that following the Lord into martyrdom would be the ultimate expression of your faith washes over you like cool spring water on a sultry summer day. Your heart is set straight and it fills with joy." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.3.a:0 "Alleluia!" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.4.t:0 "A deafening silence." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.4.desc:0 "You seclude yourself to pray in peace and instead of usual comforting feeling of closeness to God you are overwhelmed by a sensation of crushing loneliness. There is not a faintest whisper of reassurance in your head, not even the most subtle touch caressing your soul, only silence. You are alone, more than ever." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.4.a:0 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" #NT!
 POD_martyrs.5.t:0 "Armed and ready." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.5.desc:0 "Whether one faces infernal abominations or common thugs, it never hurts to be proficient with a weapon and after weeks of intense drills and sparring, you do feel a lot more proficient. Whether this newly acquired set of techniques will let you come out unscathed from the next confrontation with the enemy is highly uncertain, yet you find reassurance in having the weapon in your grip. You know you're not invincible, but at least you don't feel defenseless." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.5.a:0 "I will reach their hearts with gospel or this sharp, steel point." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.6.t:0 "Hopelessly helpless." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.6.desc:0 "Weeks have passed and you can barely execute the techniques taught to you without injuring yourself or assume the stances without falling over. It's true you skipped a few classes, but a person can only do so much in a day. Whatever the cause, the results of the training are painfully disappointing, you feel as if you can barely fend off a practice dummy, let alone a spawn of Hell." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.6.a:0 "I feel more vulnerable than before I started." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.7.t:0 "Life is cruel and then you die." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.7.desc:0 "What difference does it make if you die dismembered by a spawn of Satan or from some foul plague. Is there anyone who can say that one is better or worse than the other? One should treasure every moment they are not in horrible pain, because it only gets worse from there." #NT!
 POD_martyrs.7.a:0 "It is what it is." #NT!
