 podkueijin.120.t:0 "Chi" #NT!
 podkueijin.120.desc:0 "This Wheel of Ages turns by the interactions of Yin and Yang, represented by the divine Ebon Dragon and Scarlet Queen. Energies of creation permeate the world, flowing to and from the Yin and Yang Worlds. Called Chi, this energy flows through and among all the Ten Thousand Things.\n\nLike Kindred, Wan-Kuei suffer from hunger. When a Wan-Kuei has five or fewer Chi points (of either sort) in their body, they becomes hungry.\n\nA Wan-Kuei's Chi Virtues indicate how much of a given type of Chi the Wan-Kuei may safely channel through her body. The Wan-Kuei is easily capable of ingesting more temporary Chi than her Chi Virtues indicate (a permanent imbalance allows to ingest more Chi of that type without ill effects). However, a Wan-Kuei who abuses this practice runs the risk of an imbalance - a dangerous 'overdose' of Chi. Wan-Kuei with none of a particular type of Chi in her body is thrown in an automatic state of temporary imbalance too." #NT!
