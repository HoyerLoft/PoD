 pod_knights.1.desc:0 "You have been informed that one of your champions has been careless recently. Involved in a fight with mortals, [knight.GetSheHe] used the powers of the blood to easily crush them, a clear breach of [masquerade|E]. Worse, [knight.GetSheHe] then bragged about it in town!\nThis behavior is sure to attract the unwanted gaze of the Inquisition, but you might still be able to salvage the situation if you cut short your partnership with this annoying braggart." #NT!
 pod_knights.1.a:0 "Get out of my sight, you idiot!" #NT!
 pod_knights.1.b:0 "You are forgiven, this time" #NT!
 pod_knights.2.t:0 "The Deceitful Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.2.desc:0 "One of your champions has been a right pain in your behind for quite a while. Spreading rumors after rumors, you thought for a while that [knight.GetSheHe] was preparing some plot against you. But after a careful investigation, you are pretty sure that it is done more for the kick of it than for some ulterior motive.\nStill, this is a clear threat to your credibility and you might want to take action sooner rather than later." #NT!
 pod_knights.2.a:0 "Go away, you annoying gossiper!" #NT!
 pod_knights.2.b:0 "...Too important to simply dismiss, sadly" #NT!
 pod_knights.3.t:0 "The Wrathful Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.3.desc:0 "You don't know how it really begun. But one of your champions, known to be quite fiery, has sprung into frenzy in the middle of your court for a petty insult or the like. You have two options, you could call for the guards and your other warriors to subdue this berserker. Though, such social shaming would probably means that [knight.GetSheHe] will never walk back into your service.\nOr you could just let the frenzy runs its course, uncaring of the potential victims of it..." #NT!
 pod_knights.3.a:0 "Kick this beast out of my sight" #NT!
 pod_knights.3.b:0 "Time for some vassal culling, I guess" #NT!
 pod_knights.4.t:0 "The Craven Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.4.desc:0 "One of your champions is a known coward. Always looking for a way out of fights, [knight.GetSheHe] has become the laughing stock of your court, although none dare say it aloud... yet. You clearly anticipates that this will change soon enough, and it will be quite the stain on your prestige to host such an individual.\nYou could just endure it, or remove the coward from your service before it becomes an issue." #NT!
 pod_knights.4.a:0 "Spook this idiot out of my court" #NT!
 pod_knights.4.b:0 "Let them speak, I don't care" #NT!
 pod_knights.5.t:0 "The Greedy Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.5.desc:0 "It is the fourth time this month that one of your champions is asking for more money. You don't even know if this is about armor, arms or horse now. Or perhaps [knight.GetSheHe] didn't even care to hide the sheer greediness of it this time.\nObviously, you are entitled to make it stop right here right now, but perhaps are you valuing martial prowess more than gold?" #NT!
 pod_knights.5.a:0 "Kick this greedy bastard out of my court" #NT!
 pod_knights.5.b:0 "You will have your damn horse, or armor, whatever" #NT!
 pod_knights.6.t:0 "The Paranoid Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.6.desc:0 "One of your champions is accusing... well, almost everyone of plotting against your rightful rule. Be they mortals, courtiers, vassals or random passerby. You are pretty sure that this is a slight oversimplification of the situation, but... maybe [knight.GetSheHe] got a point.\nYour advisors are telling you to kick this bad influence out of your court but... perhaps they are in this global conspiracy too?!" #NT!
 pod_knights.6.a:0 "They have a point though..." #NT!
 pod_knights.6.b:0 "Traitors! Everywhere!" #NT!
 pod_knights.7.t:0 "The Cynical Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.7.desc:0 "Always the devil's advocate, one of your champions is constantly pestering the court, and yourself, about the hypocrisy of the Roads and the unavoidable victory of the Beast over all [cainites|E] at the end. Some of your courtiers have asked you to remove this cynical character from your entourage before his speeches start to erode the willpower of all your followers." #NT!
 pod_knights.7.a:0 "The salvation of the soul has no price" #NT!
 pod_knights.7.b:0 "...but it can wait a little longer" #NT!
 pod_knights.8.t:0 "The Vengeful Champion" #NT!
 pod_knights.8.desc:0 "A champion has come to you, asking for vengeance against a perceived slight [knight.GetSheHe] endured in a nearby town. You know this character to be very passionate about such matters and this could go far, very far. But you also know that [knight.GetSheHe] will not take kindly if you say no to this request..." #NT!
 pod_knights.8.a:0 "Take care of this yourself" #NT!
 pod_knights.8.b:0 "I will help, but we won't burn the whole place!... Not entirely at least" #NT!
