As long as one does not enter one of the conflicts, a visitor walks on a "track" appropriate to the battle they witness (a boat for a naval battle, a Roman road for a conflict during the Punic wars etc.). As long as they do not step off the track, they will not be attacked directly.\nThis is a great way to learn new (or ancients) strategies that could be relevant to your era in some way." #NT!
