 beer_merchant.1.desc:0 "A merchant enters your office, greets you properly and explains the reason for his visit: 'Travelling across this land I stayed the night at a monastery to the north of here. The friars served me the most delicious beer I have ever tasted. Beer being my trade, I inquired about the possibility of buying out a part of their sizable and ever-growing stock to sell to my clients. I was told to take this offer "higher up." My investigation into who is "higher up" has led me to you, Your Excellency. Can we make a deal?'." #NT!
 beer_merchant.a:0 "Most delicious, you say? We better sell it ourselves." #NT!
 beer_merchant.a.success.ctt:0 "You will attempt to build your own distribution network for the beer." #NT!

 beer_merchant.a.success.t:0 "The people can't get enough." #NT!
 beer_merchant.a.success.desc:0 "The merchant's instincts were correct; the beer is wildly popular with the consumers, and your distribution network can barely keep up with the demand." #NT!
 beer_merchant.a.success:0 "To health!" #NT!
 beer_merchant.a.failure.t:0 "No buyers to be found." #NT!

 beer_merchant.b.success.t:0 "A new calling." #NT!
 beer_merchant.b.success.desc:0 "The conversation with the merchant reveals that despite considering himself a lucky man, he always long to be a part of something greater, more meaningful than accumulating wealth. Encouraged by this confession to lift the veil of secrecy, you introduce him to the cause that has been calling him." #NT!

 beer_merchant.b.failure.t:0 "Sticking with the beer trade." #NT!

 beer_merchant.c.success.t:0 "Straight to the buyers." #NT!
 beer_merchant.c.success.desc:0 "Your feigned concern for the establishments where the friars' beer is to be served coupled with constant refills of the merchant's cup turn his assurance into cockiness. Before the bottle is emptied, he lists his clients like a recitation. Your plan worked like a charm, and the fact that your secretary, hidden behind the door, carefully takes notes is the paramount of your evening." #NT!

 heretic_event.1.t:0 "Heretic Undermining Nobility" #NT!
 heretic_event.1.desc:0 "A local noble approaches you with a matter that he considers demanding your attention. A charismatic preacher has taken residence in his holding and started rousing the serfs against their lord by citing the Holy Bible as supposedly condemning any pledges and oaths of allegiance.

 heretic_event.2.t:0 "A Theological Debate" #NT!
 heretic_event.2.desc:0 "The preacher believes his claims to be backed by the Holy Bible, but literacy alone does not grant one the knowledge needed to interpret Scriptures into doctrine. We will test this knowledge of his by engaging him in a theological debate on his ideas. The question is what we are aiming to accomplish." #NT!
 heretic_event.2.a:0 "Make him incriminate himself by cornering him into an admission of heresy." #NT!

 heretic_event.2121.t:0 "Guilty unless proven innocent." #NT!
 heretic_event.2121.desc:0 "The preacher may be a skilled and careful orator, but he is still a heretic. You know how sinful the implications that lie behind his nebulous allusions are. He may not be willing to admit guilt, but his troublesome antics are enough to sentence him to death. As you issue the sentence, something is nagging at you, the situation reminds you of something, but you can't quite put the finger on it." #NT!
 heretic_event.2121.a:0 "What I have written, I have written." #NT!

 heretic_event.11.desc:0 "The noble is more impressed than upset with your indirect suggestion that you're too important to help him." #NT!

 defeated_general.1.t:0 "The Defeated General" #NT!
 defeated_general.1.desc:0 "One of your office clerks approaches you with a matter most delicate. He is a confessor to a once prominent and celebrated but now disgraced general. Ever since a campaign he was tasked to lead turned disastrous, the temptation of a grave sin haunts him, the sin of taking his own life. The clerk feels powerless to prevent it and turns to you, hoping you will do better at restoring hope to this defeated man. You both visit his residence. The servant lets you into the commander's office, where you see him slumped in an armchair. Sometime after brief and awkward introductions, the general tells you: 'I just can't live like that, with this shadow of lost glory crushing me.'." #NT!
 defeated_general.1.a:0 "My good man, the days of true glory are still ahead of you!" #NT!
 defeated_general.a.success.ctt:0 "You will reinvigorate the general's spirit by convincing him to commit himself fully to your cause." #NT!

 defeated_general.113.a:0 "Did I hear a stool falling over?" #NT!
 defeated_general.21.t:0 "Learning From Past Mistakes" #NT!
 defeated_general.21.desc:0 "The general begins his tale but hesitates when he gets to the troublesome part of his story. The opportunity to have someone eager to hear him out and to listen attentively convince him to continue. You reassure the general that nobody could condemn his decisions given the information he had at that time. Hearing that from someone with apparent extensive knowledge of military matters is a tremendous relief for the tortured man. After he finishes the story, you spend hours more discussing military strategy. As you finally depart, the servant whispers, 'Thank you, I haven't seen him smile since the war.'" #NT!
 defeated_general.21.a:0 "Let's make this a regular thing!" #NT!
 defeated_general.22.t:0 "The Soldier's Plight Misunderstood" #NT!
 defeated_general.22.desc:0 "The general starts telling his story but rapidly concludes that any attempt to explain his tragedy is a waste of time. The perplexed look that inhabits your face while you ask questions betraying your lack of military knowledge betrayed your good intentions. 'Let's say... things turned terrible. Perhaps I shall elaborate some other time. I beg your forgiveness, my honourable guests, but I'm completely exhausted for the moment.'" #NT!

 defeated_general.3.t:0 "A Vulture's Feast" #NT!
 defeated_general.3.desc:0 "The general looks briefly shocked after realizing what it is that you are proposing. Quickly, relief and determination overcome the grim look on his face. 'Fine, I shall include you in my will. I have to say I did not expect that to be the outcome of this meeting. But guess I have always been the fool. Farewell." #NT!

She introduces herself as a daughter of a recently deceased friend of the cause, yet remains unaware why her father supplied you with funds and was tasked by her siblings to investigate. Reading between the lines of her introduction makes it clear that the donor must have failed to prepare a written will and his children's decision to honour his dying wish of devoting a share of their inheritance to your cause will depend on this girl's impression of you.\n\n'Will Your Excellence show me around? I want to see everything that you do here.' - she asks." #NT!
