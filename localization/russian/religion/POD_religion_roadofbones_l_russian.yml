 viaossium_desc:0 "The followers of Road of Bones value knowledge above all else. Through intense study of the unknown, the Scholars keep their Beasts at bay. They will go to nearly any lengths to learn something new, but will not needlessly sacrifice themselves for a cause. After all, their own gathered knowledge is too important to let others handle. At the same time, Scholars do not fear death; they are fascinated by it." #NT!
