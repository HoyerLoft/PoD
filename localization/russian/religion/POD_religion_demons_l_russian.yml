 avarice:0 "Avarice" #NT!
 avarice_adj:0 "Avarice" #NT!
 avarice_desc:0 "Demons of greed want to possess everything, to control all they see and deny it to others. Unlike gluttons, greedy demons don’t want to consume the things they covet, they want to keep those things forever, long after they have crumbled into uselessness. Demons of greed tend to be subtle and sly, keeping an eye on long-term gains; for an immortal being, it’s no great effort to spend three centuries gaining influence over a country or cult, as long as you have total control of it in the end." #NT!

 envy:0 "Envy" #NT!
 envy_adj:0 "Envy" #NT!
 envy_desc:0 "Demons of envy seek to destroy those who possess what demons lack — freedom, love, hope and the comfort of God’s blessing. Such demons do not want such things for themselves; what they want is to punish those who have the audacity to possess such things, who feel themselves superior for having such blessings. Only after dragging everyone else down into the mud can these demons be satisfied, knowing that no one else in Creation is happier than they are." #NT!

 gluttony:0 "Gluttony" #NT!
 gluttony_adj:0 "Gluttony" #NT!
 gluttony_desc:0 "Demons of gluttony crave sensation, to indulge every appetite and desire past the point of satiation and to keep going. Mortals usually associate gluttony with a desire for food, but truly it is simply the desire to consume, to use more resources than necessary. A demon on a gluttonous rampage chooses a particular resource — food, faith, human lives — and takes obscene joy not just in using up or destroying that thing, but flaunting the destruction and consumption to those now forced to go without." #NT!

 gluttony_adherent_plural:0 "Demons of gluttony" #NT!

 lust:0 "Lust" #NT!
 lust_adj:0 "Lust" #NT!
 lust_desc:0 "Demons of lust become lost in the urges and sensations of the physical, maddened by the possibilities of physical indulgence. These demons possess followers on a regular basis, gorging themselves on pleasure and activity before relishing the sensations of the vessels’ hideous deaths. Lusty demons are often obsessed with sex, but it’s not the only form of physical pleasure they desire — they embark on orgies of eating, fighting, drinking and destruction in the time they have available in a vessel." #NT!

 lust_adherent_plural:0 "Demons of lust" #NT!

 pride:0 "Pride" #NT!
 pride_adj:0 "Pride" #NT!
 pride_desc:0 "All demons understand the sin of pride, perhaps better than humans ever could. It was pride that was the First Sin, the sin of Lucifer and all the angels who rebelled against God rather than accept His decrees. Demons of pride still place themselves above all other entities, and demand the worship and adulation of mortal and demon alike. Lost in arrogance, a prideful demon might raze a city as punishment for a minor slight, or torture an entire society until every member agrees to love and worship it unconditionally." #NT!

 sloth:0 "Sloth" #NT!
 sloth_adj:0 "Sloth" #NT!
 sloth_desc:0 "Demons of sloth are hardly lazy; that’s a misguided, mortal view of the sin. Sloth is the need for simplicity, for convenience — an ultimately sociopathic disinterest in the world. Demons of sloth are almost all demons of death, who once shepherded souls to their final rewards. Now they crave the solitude and calm of death, the serenity of an empty world. These demons are rare, because the nothingness of Hell tends to swallow them forever; those remaining are monsters who would snuff out a country to silence a crying child, who long for absolute destruction and a world of dust and gravestones." #NT!

 wrath:0 "Wrath" #NT!
 wrath_adj:0 "Wrath" #NT!
 wrath_desc:0 "Demons of wrath are whirlwinds of carnage and destruction, monsters who rampage and kill for the sheer joy of destruction. Wrath is more than just a lust for violence, though; it is the claim of righteous anger, of inflicting punishment on those who have transgressed. Some demons of wrath see themselves as enforcers of a social order, but others don’t bother to tell themselves such lies. In any case, the demon’s obsession is with lashing out and destroying anything that frustrates, blocks or simply inconveniences it." #NT!

 #faustian_desc:0 "Their goal is to foster humanity's divine potential, the divine spark that burns in every human and then turn it against God; whether they intend to be the ones who encourage that potential, or the ones who enslave it, depends on each member's opinion." #NT!
