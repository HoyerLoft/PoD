 freeanarch_desc:0 "These [cainites|E] will never bow to any authority but the one they choose for themselves, no matter the odds. Anarchs bastions are often wild and unruly, but are a beacon of hope and freedom for many young vampires. And something to crush quickly for their elders." #NT!

 pathofhonorableaccord_adherent_plural:0 "Patriots" #NT!
 pathofhonorableaccord_desc:0 "The Path of Honorable Accord is a Path of Enlightenment that harnesses the Beast through the rigorous practice of honorable and chivalrous behavior.\n [cainites|E] on the Path of Honorable Accord place a high value on ritual and ceremony. The Sabbat's Knights therefore always participate in War Parties, ritae, ceremonies, and other pack events. As a whole, the followers of the Path seek to knit together the disparate factions of the sect under the common banner of loyalty to a cause." #NT!

 pathofdeathandthesoul_adherent_plural:0 "Necronomists" #NT!
 pathofdeathandthesoul_desc:0 "The Path of Death and the Soul is a Path of Enlightenment that suppresses the Beast by detached study of death, undeath and the soul.\nAs one of the more scholarly paths, Necronomists see the vampiric existence as a means to explore the mysteries of life and death. They divide the universe into the rational realm of flesh and physics and the irrational realm of pain, mysteries, and supernatural phenomena. To explore these differences and to find the answer to their questions, a vampire has to explore his own state and the nature of the soul. " #NT!

 pathofpowerandtheinnervoice_adherent_plural:0 "Unifiers" #NT!
 pathofpowerandtheinnervoice_desc:0 "The Path of Power and the Inner Voice is a Path of Enlightenment that controls the Beast through rigorous determination and the amassing of worldly power.\nFollowers of this Path believe the truth lies within themselves and is best found by an inner search for personal enlightenment that leads ultimately to the amassing of power. Control of the self and of the external world is the only goal worth pursuing. To this end, a vampire must develop his abilities, extend his influence, and lay his pawns." #NT!

 pathofthebeast_adherent:0 "Beast" #NT!
 pathofthebeast_adherent_plural:0 "Beasts" #NT!
 pathofthebeast_desc:0 "The Path of the Beast is a Path of Enlightenment seeking to control the Beast by accepting its urges as natural and accepting their role as a hunter among hunters.\nUnorganized and shunning the trappings of civilization, followers of the Path often eschew technology in favor of their talents inherent to their undead form." #NT!

 pathofmetamorphosis_adherent_plural:0 "Metamorphosists" #NT!
 pathofmetamorphosis_desc:0 "The Path of Metamorphosis is a Path of Enlightenment that controls the Beast by studying its limits and the limits of vampirism in general.\nThey believe that the next step is a state akin to apotheosis, which they call Azhi Dahaka, after the dragon of Persian mythology, and they will do anything – anything – to achieve it. It is a distant, lonely philosophy, removed from any needs other than the matter of sustenance." #NT!

 pathofcathari_adherent:0 "Albigensian" #NT!
 pathofcathari_adherent_plural:0 "Albigensians" #NT!
 pathofcathari_desc:0 "The Path of Cathari fashions itself as the direct counterpart of the medieval Cathars: vampires are archontic spirits, jailers of the Demiurge, placed on this world to ensure mankind will never transcend it. Caine was damned by the good creator to physicality and suffering unending, but placed above mankind in the process, to evaluate humans and tempt them away from gnosis. To this end, Albigensians (the formal titulation of a follower of the path) encourage mortal excess and materialism and deliberately break the many taboos of the ancient Cathars." #NT!

 pathofcaine_adherent_plural:0 "Noddists" #NT!
 pathofcaine_desc:0 "The Path of Caine is a Path of Enlightenment that emulates the Dark Father in order to ward off the Beast.\nThe heart of the Path of Caine lies in the exemplification of vampiric nature: The questions of existence, the limits of the vampiric form, and the changes wrought by the Embrace all drive the Noddists into endless speculation, debate, study, and research. Scholarship and historical insight are valuable, but the vampire must simultaneously develop spiritually and physically, to explore the limits of his undead form." #NT!

 pathofharmony_adj:0 "Sabbat Harmonists" #NT!
 pathofharmony_adherent:0 "Harmonist" #NT!
 pathofharmony_adherent_plural:0 "Harmonists" #NT!
 pathofharmony_desc:0 "A variant of the Path of the Beast in that it accepts the Beast as necessary for the vampire's survival.\nThe Harmonists do not believe that anything that exists is unnatural. Simply being means that an individual or force has a place. This includes vampires. Yes, the vampire's role in the natural order is somewhat unpleasant, but then the rabbit would likely feel the same way about the fox." #NT!

 pathofnight_desc:0 "The Path of Night, sometimes called the Path of the Allied Night, is a Path of Enlightenment that preaches acceptance of Caine's curse and of the Beast. Cainites must harness their powers to serve the ordained purpose of vampirism – wreaking havoc upon the mortals and inspire dread – and thereby find salvation." #NT!

 vasantasenadharma_desc:0 "Vasantasena and her Malkavian sire Unmada traveled the world throughout the Middle Ages, preaching against the Blood Bond. They rejected the vinculum, traditional Kindred hierarchy, and all loss of free will. Ultimately, they condemned the Antediluvians for their cruel tyranny through Jyhad, joining the Sabbat during its formation." #NT!

 pathofredemption_adherent_plural:0 "Martyrs" #NT!
 pathofredemption_desc:0 "The Path of Redemption is a Path of Enlightenment that fights the Beast by striving for salvation in the service of God. Naturally, these claims are somewhat inconvenient in the current societies of the Damned, but the followers of the path are often more determined to gain grace than caring about others." #NT!

 pathofleviathansabbat_desc:0 "This non canon religion has been commissioned by a Patron.\n\nOriginating from ancient Chinese uniformitarianism, is dedicated to building a Leviathan-like collective, creating a collective concept of the scholarly body through flexible indoctrination and hard laws, and eventually creating a unified collective will to evolve spiritually like a single-celled organism into a multi-celled organism." #NT!
