The Dreaming Homeland of the Glomes is a gigantic citadel grown from a living mountain. It has been sieged three times and every time the invaders were pushed back and crushed. At the heart of the structure is one of the few veins of chimerical iron. Of all the empires the Glomes are the most polarized politically. They maintain a hard line that the Solimonds must be destroyed. Hosted by the Glomes, the Winter Solstice Festival is a great Tourney held in the Dreaming that is similar to the Olympics, if the Olympics were about martial prowess.

The fire spirits who first fell in love with meat were among the empire and driven by this ill-fated passion they spent ages watching humankind and learning the ways of their odd and awesome hearts the way only a lover could. Finally, unable to hide any longer, they revealed themselves and showed the meat the working of Flame with its powers of transformation and truth. In this they doomed the inanimate world to slavery at the hands of men and women and caused the War of Making, forcing the other Empires to turn against the treasonous flames and excommunicate them. Now, the other Slow Empires search to quench the Salamanders' Anchors of the Glade. The Dreaming Homeland of the Salamanders was once a bronze vista of palaces and estates with a horizon of flame lighting up the sky. The Summer Solstice is a stately and noble masque of great beauty as well as a 4-day University where the Solimonds would gather and share their knowledge." #NT!

Found in the Deep Dreaming, the Paroseme Homeland looks like an entire country made of clouds and glass. Phantasmal animals graze on cloud-like grass and wispy folk meander the delicate countryside by foot or flight. At the very center of the realm a tower of clouds, shaped like a unicorn's horn, reaches up, as solid as marble. At the top is where the council meets. Relations are good with the Empire of Tears with a steady trade of Rain for Evaporation. The Empire of Stones is considered too boring for anything more than cursory relations.

The Mannikins have never invited anyone to their meeting place. In the politics of the empires, the Toys serve as catalysts for change. When their emissary appears, shifts in policy are close at hand. Many wonder what the secret of the black-robes is, but the other empires will never reveal what is said. The few times an emissary has addressed a whole empire, war has quickly followed. While the Mannikins have no yearly ritual, rumors persist of time stolen on New Year's Eve between 11:59 and Midnight. People whisper that in that minute all the Toys awaken and live out a whole day fully human then return to their Anchors and time rewinds to Midnight again. IF it were true, it would help explain how the Dolls know so much that remains hidden to the other empires. " #NT!

The Eshu may say they treat both Ojo and Iku the same but the Iku know that's not true. They know the Ojo see them as a joke and a nasty, bitter one at that and the moment the rest know, you drop down a few notches on their list. Many think that because they don't bow down to destiny that they aren't real Elegbara but they have a code to. Though not so exactly like the Unseelie, they mesh alright.\nThere is No Destiny--What does this mean? They are truly, ultimately, Free!\nLeave Trouble in Your Wake--Chaos snaps people out of complacency. Make those in power afraid of you and what you know.\nVengeance is Divine--They look out for themselves first and make sure anyone who messes with them ends up missing something, whether ego, valuables, or body part." #NT!

 daityas_desc:0 "The Daityas are a Hsien Court who allied to the Yama Kings in the Fourth Age but have since turned away from them. Shortly after they pledged allegiance to the Yama Kings, the society of Daityas realized that the demons would only corrupt them and feed on their life energies and so they left the alliance. Through their own dark sorceries they, too, figured out how to maintain their bodies and avoid falling into nothingness as did the other Hsien.\nThe Daityas work to encourage the coming of the Sixth Age; to bring about a time when the August Personage of Jade is forced from his Celestial Court and the Dragons and Phoenixes war against each other in a bloody conflagration. By promoting lack of belief, they seek to weaken the wall created by the August Personage and so claim their rightful place in the Celestial Court.\nThough misguided in the eyes of the other Hsien, they are not beyond redemption. If they wanted to do so, they could come back to the right path and help the Hsien in avoiding the Age of Sorrow." #NT!

In addition, they have their own branch of Wu Tan known as Hac Tao, a vile art that allows them to carry the tainted chi of the Thousand Hells into the world.\They strive to fulfill the agendas of their dark masters, bringing on the Sixth Age and corrupting most of the Middle Kingdom. Most are dark reflections of the original Hsien and some answer even prayers, on condition that they involve bloodshed and satisfaction of darker urges. Some claim that the Kura Sau are even responsible for the corruption of some dragons and phoenixes, tempting them with promises of power that only the Yama Kings can grant." #NT!

They seek to bring about the Age of Joy by convincing everyone to have a good time. Rapture, exultation, and not mere physical ecstasy is their goal. They understand that a good dinner with family and friends is more satisfying and sustaining a joy than a handful of pills. The Gods of Harmony act on their beliefs by doing good deeds, trying to get different courts of shen to work together or at least talk. They walk, and occasionally party, just like they talk.\nThe Ambassadors of Heaven are looked askance upon by the Li Shen and their relations are strained with the Yü as well. Most of the others at least enjoy their company. The Tu Shen, for their part, say they have good relations with all groups." #NT!

This emphasis on the individual leads them to resist order; they even refuse to see themselves as a court. Xian Mo is a name other Hsien give them.\nThe Quiet Ones, though, give the Shinma hope, which most gave up at the end of the Fourth Age when the Wall barred them from the Spirit World. Hanuman brought the Tao Te Hsien to a Komuko sage in the Di Fu. The Komuko resigned their position and retired to the mountains. Eventually their teachings lead to the writings now called the Tao Te Hsien, or "The Way of Imminent Hsien Power." Its ardent followers now make up the Xian Mo and their teachings have led some to pass beyond the Wall." #NT!

They dredge up ancient rivalries and long-forgotten wrongs all to disrupt the order of the Li Shen ministries. They have also, however, claimed responsibility for punishing those who are too blatant about showing their wani forms and so sometimes act as a sort of secret police. Their work encompasses spreading rumors to assassination. What do they want? Maybe they just like stirring up chaos for its own sake." #NT!

The Yü have hoarded jade for centuries and possess some of the most powerful jade artifacts to this day. They also control many Dragon Nests.\nNot all of the Yü are nobles, though.

These Shinma go toe to toe with other Shen who have interests in the less lawful business dealings of the Middle Kingdom like the Kuei-jin, Kindred, and others. None of the other Courts can afford to have bad relations with the Yü so they, in return, treat most of the others with respect. The Mu Courts and the Kuei-jin are their greatest enemies." #NT!
